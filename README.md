## 🧠 If I Had More Time...

- Integrate a **real backend** using Node.js and Express or Firebase.
- Add **user authentication** for patient login and appointment history.
- Implement **email notifications** after booking.
- Use **React Context API** for global state management.
- Add **calendar view** for availability.

---

## 🧩 Challenges & Solutions

### 1. **Doctor Availability Logic**
- **Challenge:** Simulating real-time availability.
- **Solution:** Used mock JSON data with flags like `"availableToday"`, `"onLeave"` etc. and conditionally rendered tags.

### 2. **Routing Between Pages**
- **Challenge:** Managing routes between profile, booking, and home.
- **Solution:** Implemented with `react-router-dom` and route parameters (`/doctor/:id`).

### 3. **Responsive UI**
- **Challenge:** Ensuring all views work on mobile and desktop.
- **Solution:** Tailwind CSS utility classes were used extensively for responsiveness.
